### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm on a journey to commit and contribute 365 days in a row in order to get better at coding and collaboration. Here is my streak:

[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com?user=korbal&theme=dark&hide_border=true&date_format=%5BY%20%5DM%20j)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

Update: well, I failed. But I got it over 200 days. It's still ok.
